1. If you want to see the system status during boot only temporarily, press <kbd class="cmd">âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd >T</kbd> during boot.

2. If you want to see the system status during boot permanently, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
sudo nvram boot-args="-v"
```

3. To revert back to the default behavior, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
sudo nvram boot-args=
```
