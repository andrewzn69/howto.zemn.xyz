```bash
yay: error while loading shared libraries: libalpm.so.13: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

This error can only be fixed by reinstalling yay. There is no other way to solve this error.

1. Remove `yay`:

```bash
pacman -R yay
```

2. Make a new directory and clone the `yay` repository

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git && cd yay
```

3. Build and install `yay`:

```bash
makepkg -si
```

After installation, you can use `yay` as usual.
